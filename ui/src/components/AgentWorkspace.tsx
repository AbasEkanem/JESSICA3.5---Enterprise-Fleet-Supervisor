/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   AgentWorkspace — Agent execution environment, in the agent card
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Three properties that are the whole point, unchanged since the first
   version:

   1. It does NOT auto-dismiss. The body stays MOUNTED behind
      `maxHeight: collapsed ? 0 : N`, so reopening the chevron shows the
      full transcript with zero refetch. AgentSearchCard unmounted 1.8 s
      after the run finished, which is why it could not be reused: the
      record of a ten-minute orchestration evaporated before anyone
      could read it.
   2. It shows the harness steering the agent — the blank-response, loop and
      tool-call-repair guards — as first-class rows, so a long run is
      legible instead of being a spinner.
   3. Nothing here reaches the chat. The chat holds one live line while
      this fills, then the parsed summary. This panel is the workspace.

/* ── The console card ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
   This panel used to be chromeless and painted entirely from theme css
   tokens, so it inherited whatever surface the message bubble sat on.

   It is now a card with its own dark field, in every theme, deliberately: the
   execution rail is a terminal, and a terminal is a surface you look INTO, not a
   region of the page it happens to sit in. That is also why the palette below is
   literal hex rather than tokens — the card composites over nothing but itself,
   so there is no theme scope for these values to be wrong in, and no fifth place
   to keep in sync when the app's palette changes again.

   The one boundary: the HEADER row (the line the card collapses to) stays on
   theme tokens. It is a control belonging to the message, not part of the
   console, and a dark strip floating in a light chat with no field under it reads
   as a rendering bug. `T` is that header palette; `P` is the console. */

/* ── The reveal gate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   One line at a time, in stream order, across the whole panel.

   This replaces a slot queue that broke twice, both times for the same shape of
   reason: the turn was held in an effect and RELEASED IN THAT EFFECT'S CLEANUP.
   (1) The queue object was a fresh literal every render and the header ticks at
   100ms, so the cleanup fired ten times a second and advanced the turn past the
   row that was still typing. (2) With that fixed, StrictMode's mount-time
   effect → cleanup → effect double-invoke fired the same cleanup once on mount,
   re-creating the identical failure.

   So the gate holds no turn and owns no cleanup. It is a monotonically growing
   Set of finished row keys in the PARENT:

     • a row whose key is in the set renders in full, forever;
     • the FIRST row whose key is not in the set types;
     • every row after that renders nothing at all.

   Adding a key twice is a no-op, nothing is ever released, and no cleanup path
   can advance the gate — which makes it immune to both failure modes above, and
   to a re-render at any frequency. Keys, not indices: mergeStream re-splices
   guardrails on every event, so a row's position moves under it while a key
   doesn't.
   Monotonic on purpose — a HITL resume must not rewind the gate and retype the
   record of everything that happened before the approval. */

 * reconcile. They used to render as a shell comment — `# Caught an empty response
 * and kept going` — which filed the agent correcting itself in the visual register of
 * a throwaway remark, indistinguishable at a glance from a dim command line.
 *
 * They are the opposite of a throwaway. Each one is a guardrail catching the agent
 * mid-mistake and putting the run back on course, and that is the single most
 * reassuring thing a person watching a ten-minute orchestration can see. So a
 * guardrail is a banded row, tagged for what it is, carrying its own explanation
 * as well as the verbatim steering text.
 *
 * The tag splits on the backend's own definition of severity
 * (guardrail_taxonomy.py), not on a new one invented here:
 *
 *   • `warn` — a guard that CAUGHT something wrong (an empty answer, a loop, a
 *     vague final answer) ⇒ `SELF-CORRECTION`, in amber.
 *   • `info` — a forward-looking guard that steered the agent before it went wrong
 *     ⇒ `GUARDRAIL`, in the accent.
